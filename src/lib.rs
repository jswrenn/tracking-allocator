//! # tracking-allocator
//!
//! This crate provides a global allocator implementation (compatible with [`GlobalAlloc`][global_alloc]) that
//! allows users to trace allocations and deallocations directly.  Allocation tokens can also be
//! registered, which allows users to get an identifier that has associated metadata, which when
//! used, can enhance the overall tracking of allocations.
//!
//! ## high-level usage
//!
//! `tracking-allocator` has three main components:
//! - [`Allocator`], a [`GlobalAlloc`][global_alloc]-compatible allocator that intercepts allocations and deallocations
//! - the [`AllocationTracker`] trait, which defines an interface for receiving allocation and deallocation events
//! - [`AllocationGroupToken`] which is used to associate allocation events with a logical group
//!
//! These components all work in tandem together.  Once the allocator is installed, an appropriate
//! tracker implementation can also be installed to handle the allocation and deallocation events as
//! desired, whether you're simply tracking the frequency of allocations, or trying to track the
//! real-time usage of different allocation groups.  Allocation groups can be created on-demand, and
//! with optional string key/values for metadata.
//!
//! Additionally, tracking can be enabled and disabled at runtime, allowing you to make the choice
//! of when to incur the performance overhead of tracking.
//!
//! ## examples
//!
//! Two main examples are provided: `stdout` and `tracing`.  Both examples demonstrate how to
//! effectively to use the crate, but the `tracing` example is specific to using the
//! `tracing-compat` feature.
//!
//! The examples are considered the primary documentation for the "how" of using this crate
//! effectively.  They are extensively documented, and touch on the finer points of writing a
//! tracker implementation, including how to avoid specific pitfalls related to deadlocking and
//! reentrant code that could lead to stack overflows.
//!
